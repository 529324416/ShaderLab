# ShaderLab_2017  
## Version Info
This branch is based on Unity 2018.2
## Introductions  
This is the code for the book: Unity 3D ShaderLab Development Practice Introduction, 3rd version.  
We've prepared multiple branch version for Unity version, because some version of Unity could not compatible with older project, so please select proper version to fit with your platform.  
Generally, we won't update older project version, so if we'd like to add features, it's much properly in the latest version project.  
## Notice  
Select branch which matches your Unity platform. The minimum version required for our project is 5.6.0, you may download 2017.2 instead and it should be compatible with 5.6.x  
We won't support Unity versions before 5.6.0.
## Last But Not Least  
You're very welcomed if you find bugs in our book and/or our project, please give us PR or report to us.  
Thanks~!
